Hi! I'm an astrophysicist, dubbed PhD in June 2023. 

My interests are constantly evolving, but I'm excited about work happening at the intersection of exoplanet astrophysics, stellar astrophysics, and statistics. I am particularly interested in **young and/or giant planets**, and study them using **direct imaging, astrometry, and radial velocities**. In addition to research, I spend much of my time teaching and working on STEM equity & inclusion initiatives.

### A Brief History

My excellent high school teacher, Dr. Edmundo Nunes, inspired me to pursue physics. Over a gap year between high school and college, I was first exposed to scientific research through assisting [Adric Riedel](https://adricriedel.com/about-me.html) and [Emily Rice](https://www.amnh.org/research/staff-directory/emily-l-rice) on a new [algorithm for identifying young stellar moving groups](https://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fadsabs.harvard.edu%2Fabs%2F2017AJ....153...95R&sa=D). I like to tell more junior students about the ~10 times I had to email Emily before she finally agreed to let me work with her. Persistence is important! 

I graduated with honors in mathematical physics from Brown University in 2017. In college, I explored several research areas in astrophysics through the National Solar Observatory REU, the [SETI REU](https://www.seti.org/research-experience-undergraduates), and the Stanford [Leadership Alliance](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theleadershipalliance.org%2F&sa=D). I also led [Brown Science Prep](https://sites.google.com/brown.edu/bsp/what-we-do), a student group that wrote and taught original STEM lessons for local public high school students. 

My major undergraduate research project involved collaboratively designing and benchmarking an efficient orbit-fitting algorithm (["Orbits for the Impatient," or OFTI](https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.10653)) for directly-imaged exoplanets with [Eric Nielsen](https://astro.nmsu.edu/directory/eric-nielsen.html), [Bruce Macintosh](https://www.astro.ucsc.edu/faculty/index.php?uid=bamacint), and the [Gemini Planet Imager](http://planetimager.org/) team. Since undergrad, I've worked closely with [Jason Wang](https://jasonwang.space/#home) to develop this project into [orbitize!](https://orbitize.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), an open-source Python package for direct-imaging astrometry orbit-fitting that makes the OFTI algorithm publicly available. The orbitize! collaboration has grown to over 35 contributors over the past few years, and our package is now used widely in the field of exoplanet orbit-fitting.

Over the summer of my third year of grad school, I did a research internship at Google, working with the Image Search Ranking team on deep learning for multi-modal image recognition and language understanding tasks. I wrote up a document summarizing my experience applying, which I'm happy to share upon request.
One of my favorite grad school projects has been designing, teaching, and hosting [Code/Astro](https://semaphorep.github.io/codeastro/), a week-long software development workshop for astronomers, working primarily with Jason Wang. Since our first year in June 2020, the program has more than tripled in size!

### Current Work

I'm primarily working in two research areas: 1) the orbits (and particularly eccentricities) of giant exoplanets, which I study with a variety of observational techniques, and 2) stellar variability and its implications for our understanding of young planetary systems. My interests also include high-resolution spectroscopy, optimizing the radial velocity technique, optical interferometry, and statistics and computation generally. I'm an expert in Gaussian Process regression, wavelength calibration for extreme-precision radial velocity instruments, radial velocity signal understanding, astrometric orbit-fitting, Bayesian statistics, and software development with Python and C/C++. See my CV for a complete list of relevant publications (and keep an eye on the arXiv for upcoming ones).

I'm passionate (maybe angry is a better word) about social justice in academic and non-academic spheres, and spend a lot of time mentoring junior students in formal and informal capacities. I also spend time organizing in my local community.

Besides astrophysics, service, and teaching, I like to run long distances in the woods, sing, and play the cello. I also enjoy baking, but I'm pretty terrible at it. My life goal is to meet Rosie of [Rosie's Dessert Spot](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCgb5iuoTbltGVJk4bUKtSZQ). If you can make that happen, please let me know.
